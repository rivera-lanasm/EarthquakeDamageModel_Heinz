# EarthquakeDamageModel

#### System Requirements:
- ArcGIS Pro 2.7+
- Windows 10

#### Data Downloads:
The following supplemental data sets will need to be downloaded and stored in the "EarthquakeModel\Data" folder with the following names:

| Data Source | Link to Download | Geoprocessing Instructions | Name & Location in Data Folder 
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Esri/Census| [link](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=a00d6b6149b34ed3b833e10fb72ef47b)| Export layer "USA Counties (below 1:3m)" to shapefile | esri_2019_detailed_counties\2019detailedcounties.shp| 
| Census | [link](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/TRACT/) | Download and merge all into a single nationwide tracts shapefile | tl_2019_us_tracts\2019censustracts.shp |

#### Building Centroids:
In order to estimate the number of structures impacted, the user will need to have a local geodatabase
containing building centroids for each state. Some open and public data sets that could be used are 
[Microsoft Building Footprints](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints), 
[OpenStreetMap](https://osmbuildings.org/) or 
[ORNL USA Structures](http://disasters.geoplatform.gov/publicdata/Partners/ORNL/USA_Structures/). 
The building centroids are used to calculate the count of structures within each Census Tract. 
The file path of this geodatabase will need to be updated in `config.py` for the variable "BuildingCentroids".

#### Testing Mode:
The model can be set up to run on a Task Scheduler and it will check for new earthquake events 
using the [USGS ShakeMap API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) in order to estimate impacts in near-real time. 
The model can be run in <i>testing mode</i> to demonstrate what the model outputs should look like. 
To run the model in testing mode:
1. Unzip the shape.zip files inside the ShakeMaps_Testing subdirectories.
2. Change the function parameters in main.py "testing_mode" to be <b>True</b>.
3. Update file paths in `config.py` and uncomment lines 20/21 of `main.py` (depending on which test to run)
4. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the program.

#### Instructions to set up the environment and run the program:

- Future versions of this code will be open source (non-arcpy dependent).
- For now, use [this link](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000020560) for instructions to clone your ArcGIS Pro Python environment, and then install requirements.txt in the cloned environment.
- Then, in terminal run the following lines to kickoff the Earthquake Model:  
`conda activate <file path of cloned arcpro env with geopandas installed>`    
`cd <file path of repo WorkingScripts folder ...\EarthquakeModel\WorkingScripts>`  
`python main.py`
